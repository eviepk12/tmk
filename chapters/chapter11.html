        Although of our own free will, we will not limit our action "only" to the independence of the Indonesian
        nation which is being deprived by Dutch imperialism. Such a limitation would immediately constrict us in
        economic, strategic and political terms.

        <br>
        <br>

        Power over the Malay Peninsula with the fleet headquarters of Singapore in the hands of British imperialism is
        for us a <i>"strategisch Umfasung" (strategic beveling)</i> constantly forcing us away from the field of
        struggle. This <i>Umfasung</i> is
        complemented by the anti-coloured people, white Australia in the south.

        <br>
        <br>

        In economic terms, the peninsula is of great importance to us because it has become the largest market for
        Indonesia's produce; moreover, it has many connections with the whole country. Our position between Malaya and
        Australia, and the enormous British capital in Indonesia, magnify and perpetuate British imperialism's political
        interest in Indonesian affairs. We will not be able to take away Indonesia's independence without a struggle,
        and if there is a struggle, the British soldiers will certainly be ready with their rifles.

        <br>
        <br>

        The persistence of the American presence in North-Indonesia (the Philippines) is more dangerous for us than an
        ordinary Indonesian can realise. Our strategy remains threatened both from the north and the south by modern
        imperialism. The economy of the Philippines, which produces crops like Indonesia-South, is a great competition.
        In short, as long as Indonesian politics remains divided into parts as it is now (Dutch, British, American
        parts), there can be no united economic action, such as fixing the maximum price of the produce of these
        tropical countries in the world markets. Our independence, for Uncle Sam who may very well intend to sit in the
        Philippines forever, is not a matter of mere political "philosophy".

        <br>
        <br>

        An independent Indonesia now cowering under Dutch imperialism will be joyously hailed by the Indonesians of the
        North and will lead to renewed agitation for the widest possible independence for them. The Philippines in
        Japanese hands is not good for us.

        <br>
        <br>

        On the contrary, it gradually came to mean "our common subjugation" to the modern Assyrian robber barons. One
        centre of unity among all Indonesians, namely our Indonesia. The Peninsula and the Philippines - let's not even
        talk about the Oceania Islands and Madagascar, of which there are many - are a <i>sine qua non</i>, necessary
        for the
        seizure and preservation of our freedom. Wretched indeed, the Indonesians on the Malacca Peninsula cannot defend
        themselves from the flood of Indians and Chinese who continue to flow there. Industrial commerce can be said to
        be all in foreign hands. The natives in the coastal towns are constantly being pushed to the suburbs, and those
        living on land are increasingly retreating to the mountain tops.

        <br>
        <br>

        Railway factories, government offices and commerce are all in the hands of foreigners. The overseas people from
        Java, Sumatra, Borneo and Sulawesi were too few and too weak in strength to wage an economic struggle against
        the Asian Continentals who were usually resourceful, modest and compact. The process of pushing the Indonesian
        nation in terms of residence, economy, politics and country led to the birth of a new movement there. An
        association of Indonesians called "Kesatuan-Melayu" was beneficial and we should take note of all the resources
        of the Indonesians in the Peninsula for defence and politics. Although still murky in words and hesitant in
        action, such a political body should be regarded as favourable and should be given our fullest attention. All
        efforts to develop and create a Greater Indonesian Union throughout the Indonesian Archipelago "must and need"
        to exist and be established. In addition, it can be expected that tomorrow or the day after tomorrow the
        Peninsular Indonesians will endeavour to create a movement with the intention of moving the Southern Indonesians
        there. In this way, it will be possible to limit the process of aggression and to create a basis on which an
        independent Indonesia can "rest" and finally realise All-Indonesian Independence.

        <br>
        <br>

        The Philippines, located between Sciylla in America and Charyb in Japan, is strategically "important in the
        Pacific" and for the 12,000,000 Indonesians there, it is a matter that cuts off any hope of national
        independence. The Philippines is too important, and its population too small, to repel the enemy forever.
        Therefore, it is only right that they should feel very grateful for the immigration from the South-Indonesia to
        the country, because these immigrants, if only educated to get along, will become united with them in a short
        time.

        <br>
        <br>

        As a nation of one blood, the Philippines and Southern Indonesia will certainly not disagree in appearance,
        face, nose, conversation, liking and willingness to work, and also have an unexpected language
        connection.<sup><a href="#17">[17]</a></sup>

        <br>
        <br>

        Immigration from Indonesia-South will in no way mean "colonisation" of the Filipino nation, be it economic,
        cultural, political or anything else. On the contrary, immigration would mean strengthening the nation.

        <br>
        <br>

        However, immigration would certainly not be authorised by Dutch imperialism. The contact between the
        South-Indonesians, who have been colonised and blindfolded for centuries, and the North-Indonesians, who have
        more freedom in political economy and culture, would not soon open their eyes and awaken the revolutionary
        spirit? Although the Filipinos - due to their economic considerations (higher living standards) - are against
        the immigration of labourers from the Eastern Continent, they are in favour of immigration from South-Indonesia
        in spite of the large numbers. The Filipinos can hardly deny their own history because they too are
        South-Indonesians; Javanese, Sumatrans, Peninsulars and others also migrated there.

        <br>
        <br>

        This event is very important to us now and in the future because it is one of the first joints of unity and work
        in the future. It is also of no small significance to the Philippine politics with which we are working. Most of
        the influential political leaders have told us that they were looking forward to the first "All Indonesian
        Conference". But unfortunately we do not have the time now. It is indeed a good time to lay the first stone on
        the mount of "All Indonesian Unity".

        <br>
        <br>

        Let us start, from this very minute, earnestly and joyfully work towards our ultimate goal: the establishment of
        the "Federation of Indonesian Republics" (FRI) in the truest sense of the word, the union of 100,000,000
        oppressed human beings who inhabit the strategic and transportation centre of the entire Asian continent and its
        oceans. Moreover, it means the centralisation of all the produce of tropical countries; and at the same time,
        the construction of a new culture, i.e. the rise of a new nation and a new power in the East. Therefore, it will
        be the subject of a new and irrepressible fervour for the Asian peoples who number over 1,000,000,000 and thirst
        for independence; and it will mean irreparable harm to white colonialism.

        <br>
        <br>

        The South-Indonesian nation that wants independence must understand well the task and the consequences of its
        actions and victories. From now on it must cultivate a fighting spirit against Western imperialism, whether in
        trade or military policy. We must never retreat or abandon our aspired path.

        <br>
        <br>

        Roll up your sleeves at once to revive and unite all national forces; furthermore, create a link with other
        Indonesians, anti-imperialist West or East.

        <br>
        <br>

        However, we should not rely solely on foreign aid. We should have faith in our own strength from start to
        finish.

            [17] Before the Spanish arrived in the Philippines, Malay was the official political language of the entire
            Philippines, a <i>lingua franca</i> between no less than two thousand islands. However, the Spanish politics of
            <i>devide et impera</i> killed the language. In addition, because the "Messengers of God" developed all the
            dialects that existed in each of the islands and regions of the Philippines, and they also abolished Malay,
            the official political language disappeared. With the death of the <i>lingua franca</i> came the death of the sense
            of unity among the people, and the Spanish were able to pit them against each other. That is why it is so
            difficult to build national unity to this day.
