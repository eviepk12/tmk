            [10] The <i>poenale sanctie</i> (penal sanction) was a legal
            penalty in both Suriname and the Dutch East Indies. The <i>poenale sanctie</i> was a part of the <i>Koelie
            Ordonnantie</i> ('Coolie Ordinance') of 1880 and stipulated that a plantation-owner could punish his
            workers in any
            manner he saw fit, including fines.

            [11] An advisory body for the colonial
            government made up mostly of dutch and indies nationals, not to be confused with the \emph{volksraad} which was
            a later institution borned out of the ethical policy that allowed educated aristocrats of the Indonesian
            population to participate.
