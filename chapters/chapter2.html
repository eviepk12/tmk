        <h3>Foreign Influence</h3>

        <p>
            The history of Indonesia is not easy to read, let alone write. The history of
            our nation is full of mysticism, legends, stories, and contradictions. No historian
            from the Majapahit Empire or Mataram has come close to the historians of Rome more
            or less 1400 years ago, like Tacitus or Caesar. We are forced to admit that we have have never known an
            honest
            historian.
        </p>

        <br>
        <br>

        <p>
            At best we have fairy tales, legends, and courtiers of the king that tell all sorts of
            beauty and brilliance to attract the listener's heart.
        </p>

        <br>
        <br>

        <p>
            But even then there is also a limit to the imagination and twisting of actual events. We don't have to go
            too far beyond that boundary, and we will surely come across the real essence. So it is with the histories
            of our country. Amongst the kinks in the fabric, the truth is revealed, the Indonesian Archipelago, the
            kingdoms and cities that rose and fell, the armies that marched, fought, lost and won, the wealth, the
            stability, the cultural ups and downs and so on. It is undeniable that there were great states in Malacca,
            Sumatra and Java. Even in Central Borneo, there was a kingdom that was not much less than the Majapahit
            Kingdom. There were large cities full of beautiful buildings and jewellery, as evidenced by items found in
            the ground up to the present time.
        </p>

        <br>
        <br>

        <p>
            It is also certain that Indonesia has never stepped out of its feudal society, and that it is far removed
            from
            feudalism in Europe. The Greeks were far superior to the Indonesians - in this case Majapahit if this
            kingdom is considered the highest level - in terms of state government, politics, law and culture. Yes, the
            people of Majapahit actually never recognised the ideal of state government. For centuries the government
            was not for and belonged to the people. The words: <i>"For you, my Lord, the freedom, the belonging and the
                life of the people,"</i> have been said over and over again by the people of Indonesia to their kings!
            There was no Orachus, no Magna Charta, and no well-researched knowledge like that of Aristotle, Pythagoras
            and
            Photomeus. Our knowledge of architecture and medicine was still at an experimental level. The wonders of our
            Borobudur are not as miraculous as the Pythagorean triangle, because the former leads to a dead path, while
            the
            latter leads mankind to various kinds of knowledge. Nowhere is there a trace of knowledge and the pinnacle
            of the mind's intelligence!
        </p>

        <br>
        <br>

        <p>
            That said, let's not talk about Eastern Mysticism! This is beyond our material knowledge; moreover,
            the Western nations in the Dark Ages (Middle Ages) have known it for long. After all, mysticism is
            not based on material truth, our society has always obtained from foreign influences and never has
            its own ideals. Hinduism, Buddhism, and Islam are imported goods, not the product of our society.
        </p>

        <br>
        <br>

        <p>
            In addition, these ideals did not grow as much as Christianity in Western Europe.
            The driving force behind the entry of Hinduism, Buddhism, and Islam up to the time of
            the arrival of Dutch capitalism, and all civil wars at that time were abroad. Indonesia
            had always been the puppet, and the masters are always abroad.
        </p>

        <br>
        <br>

        <h3>The Authentic Indonesian Nation</h3>

        <p>
            In ancient times, when the indigenous Indonesians were
            pressured by the Chinese and Hindus coming from their land - the Indies - and
            fled to the Indonesian Archipelago, they already had established civilization.
            The peasants of the time turned into pirates who were ferocious and feared by the people.
            With their Vintas (a small type of boat), they sailed across the islands between two large
            oceans, between America and Africa. The Indians and Oceania were conquered by them. The jungle
            to the top of the mountain was turned into their new home. Those homes they made, culture,
            and knowledge. When the Western and Eastern nations worshipped the sword of Genghis Khan and
            Timur Lang and fled in fear, at that time they not only resisted but were also able to repel
            the Mongol army. The pirates named Pakodato from the Kingdom of Singapore in the Malay peninsula
            500 years ago were able to shake the Kingdoms of China and India with their mighty fleets and swords.
        </p>

        <br>
        <br>

        <h3>Hindu Influence</h3>

        <p>
            Presumably the tropical climate in the neighbourhood of the sun is the main reason for our lack of technical
            progress. The fertile and debilitating climate, as well as the small population, made the happy peasantry
            settle
            down and settle in, while the vast archipelago attracted the people on the coasts to travelling and
            experience.
            According to history it is known that, after the Hindu influence was brought in, their culture improved and
            they
            became acquainted with the usurpers. This happened after our nation had mixed blood with the Hindu invaders.
            Now
            we can imagine the events that can be described by these events, which awakened the latent energy to become
            dynamic. It is not due to our own life struggles (against or between classes) that we have described the
            feudalistic cultural techniques mentioned above, but due to external influences.
        </p>

        <br>
        <br>

        <p>
            Let us leave here the matriarch rule in Minangkabau, which is related to its natural conditions and remote
            position. With the establishment of Indonesia's only democracy, we also leave the history of Srivijaya and
            other
            kingdoms on the island of Java, showing only the broad outlines. The religion of the Indonesian people,
            animism,
            was suppressed by Hinduism and Buddhism, so people tell us. The smarter nation taught them more perfect
            government and cultural techniques. The peaceful inhabitants of Java did not yet have class conflicts in the
            broadest sense. They did not allow the followers of Hinduism to stake their faith in a conflict between
            aristocratic Hinduism and the more democratic Budhism. The sharpness of the religious conflict was muted by
            the
            classless Javanese. More or less, all Hindu philosophy was accepted by the original Javanese islanders.
            Shiva,
            Vishnu, and the gods of Buddhism, which in their native lands were hostile and separate, lived together
            peacefully on Java.
        </p>

        <br>
        <br>

        <p>
            In such a case, Islam came and eventually took the place of Hinduism and Buddhism.
        </p>

        <br>
        <br>

        <p>
            Today's Javanese is a "crystallisation" of various deities and religions of the gods (animism). They are not
            animists, not Hindus, not Buddhists, not Christians and not true Muslims. Indonesian by nature, but
            Hindu-Arabic
            in his mind.
        </p>

        <br>
        <br>

        <h3>Empu Sedah Pessimism</h3>

        <p>
            In the strong and famous Kingdom of Daha ruled by King Jayabaya, a smart and clever,
            even yet wise, there was a fortune teller named Empu, who was always upset because he
            was very suspicious of foreign influences that were getting relevant and relevant.
            In his writings, it mentioned: “A revolution in Java will arise, led
            by yellow people and will gain victory for some time”. In his sarcastic
            words, it's written “it will reign for a lifetime”.
        </p>

        <br>
        <br>

        <p>
            Isn't that prediction then proven by the victory of a Chinese Javanese
            named Mas Garendi that for a short time controlled the city of Kartasura?.
        </p>

        <br>
        <br>

        <p>
            In the time of Empu Sedah, the influence of China gradually increased.
            It is logical for Chinese people to use the Javanese nobility as a tool to fulfil
            their economic interests as much as possible!
        </p>

        <br>
        <br>

        <p>
            If this goal does not succeed with their influence, sometimes by way of revolution then
            try to seize the state government. But, in order for them to keep their power, they must be
            stronger or establish their own class. They must be natives or inter marry with the indigenous
            people. Only then could they conquer the kingdom through the displeased peasants. Because the
            Chinese socially remained with their Chinese heritage and did not receive military assistance
            from their motherland, they were soon able to maintain the victory of the Javanese kings.
        </p>

        <br>
        <br>

        <p>
            Empu Sedah understood how much hatred the people and the revolution had if it were to break
            out. While their power nationally is not strong enough to withstand the social revolution. That's what made
            him nervous.
        </p>

        <br>
        <br>

        <p>
            In the Majapahit Kingdom stood several batik, tiles, and ship companies with considerable capital.
            Some companies employed several thousand workers. Some of its captains had sailed as far as Persia
            and China with their ships. It can because they had such a big capital, even foreign capital.
            The rich merchants in cities such as Gampel, Gresik, Tuban, Lasem, Demak, and Cirebon were probably
            foreigners or had intermarried with the Javanese. Nakhoda Dampu-Awang, according to his exaggerated
            story, had a ship whose sail was as high as Mount Bonang, and his wealth described as such, they feel like
            Chinese-Javanese.
            One statistic at that time we did not have! But the nationality of peoples living on the island of Java can
            be proven by the words of a Majapahit poet, named Prapanca, <i>“consistently people came in droves from
                various
                nations.
                From the Mainland-Indies, Cambodia, China, Annam, Champa, Karnataka, Guda, and Siam with ships
                accompanied
                by many merchants of
                renowned Brahmana clerics, scholars, and priests, ready to come to be entertained and to stay”</i>
        </p>

        <br>
        <br>

        <p>
            Of course, the inhabitants of the increasingly developed cities felt they were gaining resistance to the
            nobility in
            the capital. As in European countries, urban dwellers were demanding further political and economic rights.
            From
            the contradiction between the coast and the land, trade, and agriculture, the population and the government,
            a revolution arose that brought the island of Java to the pinnacle of economy and government.
        </p>

        <br>
        <br>

        <p>
            If the city had a strong national industry and trade, Java would surely experience a social revolution that
            is
            raised, broken, and led by a social revolution that is raised, broken and led by national progressive forces
            as happened in Western Europe, the bourgeois revolution against the feudalists.
            But Java was indeed bound by Empu Sedah's prophecy: “foreigners will rule”.
        </p>

        <br>
        <br>

        <p>
            A Hindu named Malik Ibrahim in 1419, brought a new religion not yet known in the Island of
            Java, came to Gresik where at that time the residents were mostly foreigners. Quickly he
            gained a number of followers. So it can be said, with the arrival of Islam at that time, the
            indigenous people as if gaining “the fallen durian”, because at that time there was a fiery
            conflict between the coastal population and the capital.
        </p>

        <br>
        <br>

        <p>
            The situation became more complicated, and eventually reached its peak,
            the attack on the king led by a Chinese-Javanese, named Raden Patah. By his actions,
            Raden Patah destroyed the existing kingdom. It shows again that a foreigner,
            by bringing a new understanding (Islam) and to maintain the position of foreign merchants on the c
            oast, succeeded in overthrowing the half-hindu aristocratic kingdom. The kingdom of
            Demak stands by its fame! But it was eventually torn apart by a merchant war ignited by cunning
            foreigners.
        </p>

        <br>
        <br>

        <p>
            Jipang was hostile to Pajang, Demak to Mataram. All these civil wars,
            large or small, for the benefit of foreign nations, in a short time ended with the victory
            of a Chinese-Javanese named Mas Garendi.
        </p>

        <br>
        <br>

        <h3>Tarunajaya</h3>

        <p>
            As in Rome and China, the mounds of unrighteous rulers in the capital were swept away by new forces from the
            regions; so, too, the blood of the Mataram Kingdom would be cleansed and strengthened by Tarunajaya and his
            friends.
        </p>

        <br>
        <br>

        <p>
            An Indonesian prince who came from Makassar knew the soul of the Javanese people gained a large
            following, and managed to defeat the King of Mataram who came out of the true lineage. Java in
            particular and Indonesia in general will have a different history if a new power does not come
            to Java. Empu Sedah's other prophecy now seems to be proven, "The government of a foreign nation,
            namely a white buffalo with eyes like a cat's eyes" <i>(kebo bule siwer matane)</i>.
        </p>

        <br>
        <br>

        <p>
            With the advent of Dutch rule, everything resembling independence disappeared. The influence of
            foreigners and the mixing of blood with other Asian nations caused a great deal of tension. All
            economic and political rights were "swallowed" by the Netherlands with violence and fraud, as the
            Indonesian nation has never known! Extortion of the lowest form (barbarism) and tyranny have become a daily
            habit!
        </p>

        <br>
        <br>

        <p>
            Tarunajaya could not resist the Dutch rule using foreign weapons. So the cat saw this situation and
            for the first time used the political path of <i>devide et impera</i>, splitting and dominating that worked
            wonderfully for the colonialist. After the King of Mataram promised the East India Company to give
            them power and land, the devil's hands began to work.
        </p>

        <br>
        <br>

        <p>
            Panembahan in Madura, a friend from Tarunajaya, was stuffed by the East India Company with diamonds
            and sweet words until they could get along. Now Tarunajaya stands between the “three fires”: the Dutch,
            the king, and old friends. This is what caused the defeat of Tarunajaya witnessed by the East India Company
            itself!.
        </p>

        <br>
        <br>

        <p>
            The indiscriminate Mataram government received a "victory" due to the indirect support of the Company, but
            something indiscriminate will sooner or later become a reality as well as proven in the end.
        </p>

        <br>
        <br>

        <h3>Diponegoro</h3>

        <p>
            The road from Anyer to Banyuwangi, which connects the robbed districts, was built by Governor General
            Daendels with a lot of sweat and the lives of Javanese people at stake. With that road,
            the process of capital cultivation becomes orderly. But the process was not voluntarily accepted by
            the Indonesian nation. It is a coercive process and not according to the laws of nature. Merchants in
            the cities were urged. Sailing was monopolised by the Dutch, indigenous people were forbidden to
            have property rights. Cheap cotton imports from the West destroyed industry and trade, both
            small and medium. The Javanese bourgeoisie or half of Java can continue its journey, namely
            the journey between feudalism to capitalism. However, it was squeezed to dryness by Western
            capital and its apparatus; such is the feudalism of Mataram that almost fell.
        </p>

        <br>
        <br>

        <p>
            A boy with a will as hard as steel, as influential as a hot iron, that is, a man who has
            in his chest the qualities of a true Indonesian prince, powerless to change that
            unfortunate fate. If Diponegoro was born in the West and placed himself in the face of
            a revolution with such a sacred heart, it may be that he will be able to match Cromwell
            or Garibaldi. But he “helps a leaking boat”, a class that will disappear. His deeds,
            though full of chivalry, in the economic view were counter-revolutionary. And it is
            very difficult to ascertain, what kind of Diponegoro in the political view, because it
            is undeniable that his ideal is "Singgasana Kerajaan Mataram"(Throne of the Mataram Kingdom).
            A power that can easily turn into tyranny.
        </p>

        <br>
        <br>

        <p>
            Diponegoro supports further capital expansion as well as road expansion. Therefore,
            it hinders income and economic growth, counterrevolutionary. We never read that he
            opposed capital-imperialism by reviving national capital. In short, he has no political
            or economic program. He felt pressured by the new power and after he saw that the new power
            was using the decayed power of Mataram as a tool, so he attacked the two enemies.
        </p>

        <br>
        <br>

        <p>
            If Java had a revolutionary national bourgeoisie, Diponegoro in his struggle against
            Mataram and the Company must have stood on the side of the bourgeoisie. In this way,
            a noble and certain deed can be created. But that was not the case, the bourgeoisie
            that smelled of Islam in the economic field was destroyed by Dutch capital altogether.
            In great frustration with Mataram and the Company, it was able to unite under the
            leadership of Kyai Mojo, a fanatical Muslim cleric with the slogan "War of Sabilullah", not national.
        </p>

        <br>
        <br>

        <p>
            Drawing a conclusion on the Diponegoro uprising is not an easy job. Because of this,
            the struggle of the Javanese Islamic bourgeoisie against the Western capital is supported
            by a kingdom that is about to fall (Mataram).
        </p>

        <br>
        <br>

        <p>
            The consequences are very clear. No one is able, however smart, to help
            a weakening class, both technically and economically, against a class that is getting stronger and
            stronger.
        </p>

        <br>
        <br>

        <p>
            A new class must be established in Indonesia to fight modern Western imperialism.
        </p>

        <br>
        <br>

        <p>
            What are the conclusions from the above stories?
        </p>

        <br>
        <br>

        <p>
            First, that our history is Hindu history or half Hindu history; second
            that the feeling of national grandeur is far from where it's supposed to be; and
            lastly, that every thought that aspires for development (renaissance) has the same
            meaning as digging into the aristocracy and colonisation of the Hindu nation and the half-buried Hindu
            nation.
        </p>

        <br>
        <br>

        <p>
            The true Indonesian nation from then until now still remains an obedient slave from foreign robbers.
        </p>

        <br>
        <br>

        <p>
            The true nationality of Indonesia does not exist unless there is an intention to liberate the Indonesian
            nation that has never been independent.
